## Week1 - How we got here
1. Performance of a database system comes from?
    - Hardware
        - The speed of the processor
        - Number of processors
        - Number of disk drives and I/O bandwidth
        - Size of main memory
        - Communication network
        - Type of architecture
    - Software
        - Type of database technology used for a given application
    - Database tuning, crash recovery
        - Indexing parameters
        - Data duplication
        - Sharing data, etc

2. a classical disk
    - basic hardware

    - Disk access
     - $f(x)=ax+b$
        Disk access time = seek time + rotational time + transfer length /
3. SSD (Solid-State Drive/Solid-State Disk)
